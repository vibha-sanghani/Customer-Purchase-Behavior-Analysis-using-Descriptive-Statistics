# Customer-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis-using-Descriptive-Statistics

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes customer purchasing patterns using descriptive statistics, probability distributions, and machine learning techniques to optimize marketing strategies. The dataset includes customer demographics, purchasing history, and engagement details.  

## 🎯 Objective  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key trends and correlations.  
- Apply **descriptive statistics** (mean, median, variance, standard deviation) to analyze customer spending behavior.  
- Use **probability distributions** (Normal, Binomial, Exponential) for behavioral insights.  
- Implement **K-Means clustering** for customer segmentation.  
- Reduce dimensionality using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.  
- Visualize insights using **Matplotlib & Seaborn** to optimize business strategies.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Customer Demographics** (Age, Income, Education, Marital Status, etc.)  
- **Purchasing Behavior** (Amount spent on various products, purchase methods)  
- **Engagement** (Website visits, complaints, offer acceptance)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn  

## 📊 Statistical & ML Techniques  
- Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Variance)  
- Probability Distributions (Normal, Binomial, Exponential)  
- Clustering (K-Means) for Customer Segmentation  
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)  
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
